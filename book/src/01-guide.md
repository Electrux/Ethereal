# Introduction

Welcome to the Ethereal Language's User Manual. In this manual, you will be able to understand the usage of the language and you will be provided with ample examples for the same.

Ethereal is an interpreted, procedural, general purpose programming language which is fundamentally developed to write scripts in a very simple and efficient manner. Originally it was just a hobby, fun project, but honestly, this guide wouldn't exist if this was *just another side project*.

Note that this guide will not dive deep in the technical details of the language unless required instead, focusing on the usage of the language by the user.

This guide also intends to go over the standard library of the language with some examples to help understand better and quicker.
