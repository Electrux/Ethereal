# The Ethereal Language

The Ethereal language is an interpreted, dynamically typed, procedural, and general purpose programming language.
It is most suitable for writing scripts, the fundamental reason being, ease of use and simplicity.

Ethereal is, by design, a relatively small language. This is not a shortcoming though.
It is meant to be small since its main purpose is in scripting which usually does not require a huge set of complex features and hence, it's a rather minimal language, focusing primarily on providing decent performance with ease of use.

This book is made to guide people who want to understand Ethereal and perhaps use it in their daily life.
The book shall be the holy grail for this language as it is meant to go over every feature of the language.

Anyway, without further ado, let's go to the installation of the language, and start using it!
