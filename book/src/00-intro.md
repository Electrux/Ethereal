# Introduction

Welcome to the Ethereal Language's User Manual. In this manual, you will be able to understand the usage
of the language and you will be provided with ample examples for the same.

Ethereal is an interpreted, procedural, general purpose programming language which is fundamentally developed
to write scripts in a very simple and efficient manner. It is most suitable for this use case because of ease of use and simplicity.
Originally it was just a hobby, fun project, but honestly, this guide wouldn't exist if this was *just another side project*.

By design, Ethereal is a relatively small language. This is not a shortcoming though.
It is meant to be small since its main purpose is in scripting which usually does not require a huge set of complex features
and hence, it's a rather minimal language, focusing primarily on providing decent performance with ease of use.

This book is made to guide people who want to understand Ethereal and perhaps use it in their daily life.
The book shall be the holy grail for this language as it is meant to go over every feature of the language.

Note that this guide will not dive deep in the technical details of the language unless required instead,
focusing on the usage of the language by the user.

This guide also intends to go over the standard library of the language with some examples to help understand better and quicker.

Anyway, without further ado, let's go to the installation of the language, and start using it!
